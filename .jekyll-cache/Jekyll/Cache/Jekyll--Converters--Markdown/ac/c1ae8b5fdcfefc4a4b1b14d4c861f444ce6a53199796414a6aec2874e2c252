I"Ş<p>As a 9-year-old, Peggy Whitson watched Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin be the first people to walk on the moon in 1969. When her father got his private pilotâ€™s license the next year, Whitson remembered:</p>

<div class="quotes">
â€œI got to go on my first airplane ride and see the Earth from above. Itâ€™s an amazing perspective at 10 years old.â€
</div>

<p>This also inspired Whitson to learn how to fly about 10 years later. After getting her doctorate in biochemistry, she joined NASA instead of further pursuing her academic career. She said:</p>

<div class="quotes">
â€œI had a couple of prestigious folks tell me this was not the right thing to do. I persevered anyway.â€
</div>

<p>Flying into space takes only about eight-and-a-half minutes according to Whitson. You go from zero to 17,500 miles per hour in that time. Whitson still remembers eating food in space that had to be dehydrated and then rehydrated. Things like oatmeal and mac and cheese</p>

<div class="quotes">
â€œwork pretty good. [...] The veggies that are dehydrated and rehydrated â€” those are kind of squishy.â€
</div>

<p>Her favorite space food is chicken fajitas.</p>

<div class="quotes">
â€œI never got tired of it in the 665 days I was up there.â€
</div>
