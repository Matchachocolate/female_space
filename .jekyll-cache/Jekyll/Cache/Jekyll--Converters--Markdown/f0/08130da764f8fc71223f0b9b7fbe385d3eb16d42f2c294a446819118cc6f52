<p>Seeing the world through the lenses of a medical doctor, scientist, photographer, astronaut and author, Dr. Roberta Bondar follows in her family‚Äôs tradition of excellence in teaching. Trained as a member of NASA‚Äôs Earth Observation Team Dr. Bondar expanded her professional photographic expertise. After her space mission, she continued her photographic explorations honing her artistic and technical skills as an honors student in Professional Nature Photography. As a landscape photographer her work is represented by galleries in London, England, Vancouver, Toronto and Calgary and is featured in numerous books and other publications.
A childhood dream to be an astronaut was realized when Dr. Roberta Bondar launched from Earth in January 1992 aboard NASA‚Äôs Space Shuttle Discovery as the first neurologist in space and Canada‚Äôs first female astronaut. Representing the international scientific community, she conducted over forty advanced experiments for fourteen nations.
Back on Earth, Dr. Bondar and her team of researchers examined data obtained from astronauts on 24 space missions to better understand the mechanisms underlying the body‚Äôs ability to recover from exposure to space.</p>

<p>Dr. Roberta Bondar is unique, not just for being the world‚Äôs first neurologist in space or for her pioneering space medicine research. Academically one of the most distinguished astronauts to have flown in space, Dr. Bondar is also the only astronaut to use fine art photography to explore and reveal Earth‚Äôs natural environment from the surface.</p>
