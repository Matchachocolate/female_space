I"'<p>In 1992, US astronaut, doctor and engineer Mae Carol Jemison became the first African-American woman to go to space aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavor on a mission named STS-47. Jemison was born in 1956 as the youngest of three children in Alabama and moved to Chicago at the age of three. As a big Star Trek fan growing up, she aspired to go into space and had no doubt she would achieve that big goal one day. In a 2007 interview, Jemison said:</p>

<div class="quotes">
“As a little girl… I always assumed I would go into space. [...] Let me make sure that’s clear: I just always assumed, despite the fact that the US hadn’t sent any women up there, or people of color, that I was going to go.”
</div>

<p>Little did she know that she would one day become the first real astronaut that starred in an episode of Star Trek. At the age of 16, Jemison received a scholarship from Stanford University and started studying chemical engineering and African and African-American studies. After graduation, she got a medical degree from Cornell University Medical College in New York in 1981. She later worked as a general practitioner, spending several years in the Peace Corps in West Africa.</p>

<p>Mae Carol Jemison today is a science ambassador and makes an effort to democratize access to technology for the future of humanity. She told Stanford Today in an interview in 1996:</p>

<div class="quotes">
“I think it’s so vitally important that all people in this world are involved in the process of discovery.”
