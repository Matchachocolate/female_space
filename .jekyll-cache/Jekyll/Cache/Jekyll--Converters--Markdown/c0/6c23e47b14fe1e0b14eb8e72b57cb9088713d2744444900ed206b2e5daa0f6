I"¯<p>Anna Lee Fisher didnâ€™t hesitate when NASA offered to send her to space when she was already pregnant. 14 months after giving birth, the astronaut made history by becoming the first mother in space. On a Friday, she gave birth to a daughter named Kristin. The following Monday, she was already back at NASA attending team meetings. She wanted to make a statement and prove to her male co-workers and managers that she might have just had a baby but she was still on the job. Fisher recalled:</p>

â€œIt was worth it just to see the looks on their faces.â€

<p>In 1984, she was part of NASAâ€™s second trip using the space shuttle Discovery. Fisher was aware of the risk she was taking when she agreed to join the seven-day, 23-hour mission that focused on retrieving and dispatching satellites. Back in the day, she couldnâ€™t call her daughter or family on board of the space shuttle as it is common for todayâ€™s astronauts. While sitting at the window of the spacecraft, she was listening to a tape with a recording of her daughter Kristin saying, â€œI luh, I luh.â€ I love you.</p>

<p>Fisher returned safely home after traveling more than 3 million miles in space. At the age of 67, she retired from NASA in 2017. Shortly after, she became a grandmother and is now helping her own daughter Kristin navigate the same worries she had after becoming a new mom herself.</p>
