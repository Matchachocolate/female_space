in a Superman cape hoping to fly. She sometimes spent the night sleeping in a treehouse, on the ground or in a barn. Still, her mother was never too concerned when she didn’t know where Wally was and said:
**"I knew exactly what Wally was going to do."**
Her dream finally came true when she became the first female flight instructor and pilot at a military base and taught more than 3000 students how to fly. She often used to tell young people:
**"Ride a horse. [...] Go out and play. Work on a car."**
Wally Funk almost ended up flying into space in 1961 as she was part of a group of female pilots who took part in tests to determine if women were fit for space travel. They passed many of the same tests as the men and became known as the Mercury 13. These women never got to go to space but Wally Funk didn’t give up. At the age of 82, she joined the crew on the New Shepard rocket, which launched on July 20th 2021. On that day, she broke the record and became the oldest person to reach space by beating John Glenn’s record set in 1998.
