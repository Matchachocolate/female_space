          <p>Svetlana Evgenievna Savitskaya was born in Moscow and developed a passion for flying in her early childhood as her father, Yevgeny Yakovlevich Savitsky, served as Commander of the Soviet Air Defense Forces and became a national hero after his performance as a fighter pilot in World War II.
At the age of 16, Savitskaya decided to become a pilot but got rejected from flying school first because of her young age. However, she was permitted to take up parachuting instead. By the time she was 17, she had already completed 450 parachute jumps.</p>

<p>One year later, she was admitted to the prestigious Moscow Aviation Institute (MAI). Parallel to her studies at the mentioned institution, Savitskaya took flying lessons at a paramilitary technical school called the Central United Flight Technical School at the Central Committee of the DOSAAF where she qualified as a pilot-instructor in 1971.</p>

<p>19 years after Valentina Tereshkova became the first woman in space, Savitskaya followed in her footsteps. She flew alongside Leonid Popov and Alexander Serebrov on the Soyuz T-7 spacecraft to the Soviet space station Salyut 7 on August 19th 1982. Their mission lasted seven days, 21 hours and 52 minutes. After returning to Earth, Savitskaya made headlines as the second woman to travel into space as she beat NASA astronaut Sally Ride by 10 months.</p>
