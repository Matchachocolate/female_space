          <p>Iranian born Anousheh Ansari moved to the United States as a teenager where she earned a bachelor’s degree in electronics and computer engineering and a master’s degree in electrical engineering. She also holds an honorary doctorate from the International Space University. From very early on, Ansari has been very passionate about space traveling and said in a 2021 interview:</p>

<div class="quotes">
“Since I was very young, I’ve always wanted to go to space. It’s what inspired me to study sciences, physics, math, and go in the direction I went. It was and still is a big passion of mine to understand our universe, how it’s built, my relationship to it. To me, it’s this extraordinary place of discovery and exploration.”
</div>

<p>She became the first female space tourist spending nine days on the International Space Station aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft. She reflected:</p>

<div class="quotes">
“Space is the answer to our future on Earth. As the population grows, as our way of life requires more consumption of resources, we won’t be able to sustain life as we know it without access to the resources of space. [...] Space will allow us to understand our planet and be able to predict things better.”
</div>

<p>Today, Ansari is CEO of XPrize which is a California-based nonprofit organization that supports scientific innovation.</p>
