          <p>Barbara Radding Morgan started off her career as a math and language teacher in 1974 before becoming an astronaut. When President Ronald Reagan announced a teacher would be sent to space, she applied immediately and was selected out of more than 10,000 applicants. Morgan trained as a backup alongside astronaut Christa McAuliffe, in preparation for the STS 51-L Challenger mission. On January 28th 1986, the Challenger exploded shortly after liftoff and seven crew members lost their lives. Morgan shared in an interview with NASA:</p>

<div class="quotes">
“Christa was, is, and always will be our ‘Teacher in Space,’ our first teacher to fly.”
</div>

<p>Following the Challenger accident, Barbara Morgan took on the duties for the “Teacher in Space” and was made NASA’s first Educator Astronaut in 1998. She flew into space as a mission specialist aboard Endeavour in 2007. Morgan reflected on the similarities between astronauts and teachers:</p>

<div class="quotes">
“Astronauts and teachers learn and share; they explore; they discover; and then they go learn and share some more. And that’s what this is all about.”
</div>

<p>Morgan claimed it was her hope that young people could see an “ordinary person” doing something extraordinary in space. She adds:</p>

<div class="quotes">
“It’s all about learning and exploring, and we want them to come with us.”
