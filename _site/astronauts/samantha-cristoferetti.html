          <p>CSamantha Christopheretti was the first female astronaut in Italy. She set a record for a European woman to perform a single mission in space. She spent all her time on the International Space Station and was awarded the Medal of Merit of the Republic of Italy. She enjoyed learning foreign languages and was passionate about the humanities. In the aerospace industry where most of them are men, Gender is an inescapable issue, but Samantha Christopheretti’s excellence is still obvious to all.</p>

<div class="quotes">
" When it comes to NASA, you hear a lot that we haven’t reached gender balance ...So many women have been to space compared to so many more men, but you’re putting together all of history and all those decades in which women were either not there or a very small minority. It’s a little bit unfair to hold us accountable for decades in the past."

<p>Before becoming an astronaut, Cristoforetti specialized in aerospace propulsion and lightweight construction at the Technical University of Munich, Germany, and obtained a master’s degree in mechanical engineering. She joined the Italian Air Force in 2001 and served as an officer candidate and squad leader for four years. She flew six types of aircraft and had a flight time of more than 500 hours. In May 2009, Samantha was selected as an ESA astronaut. She joined ESA in September 2009. From November 2014 to June 2015, as a flight engineer for Expedition 42 and Expedition 43, she spent 200 days in space on the Futura mission to the International Space Station. After completing the mission, Samantha was granted technical and management duties at the European Astronaut Center. Later, Samantha Cristoforetti has been leading the Spaceship EAC project. In 2019, Samantha in the world’s only undersea research station, Aquarius, served as the commander of NASA’s 23rd Extreme Environment Mission Operations (NEEMO23) mission on a 10-day stay. Until now, the 44-year-old Samantha is still entrusted with important tasks. She was assigned to the International Space Station to perform the second mission scheduled for 2022 and is receiving training on the mission.</p>
