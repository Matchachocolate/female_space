          <p>Astronaut flight applicants often default to being men, and discrimination against women has become the norm. Valentina Tereshkova became the “trailblazer” of women in aerospace. She was the first woman in space, the first Soviet astronaut, the youngest woman in space, the first civil space, and the only one to fly solo in space. Tereshkova opened a new path for women in space.</p>

<div class="quotes">
Talking to the BBC about her 48-orbit flight, she said: “It made me happy for womankind. It proved that they could be equal with men, not only on Earth but in space as well.”

<p>Tereshkova’s interest in skydiving changed her life. Tereshkova was born in a small village in Russia. Her parents worked on a collective farm, and her father was also killed during World War II. After Tereshkova joined the Yaroslavl Aerosports Club at the age of 18, she became interested in skydiving and jumped more than 150 times. In 1961, Tereshkova was inspired by Yuri Gagarin to become the first man in space, and Tereshkova signed up for the Soviet space program. In the end, she was admitted because of her experience of skydiving hundreds of times. On June 16, 1963, Valentina Tereshkova with her solo mission and Vostok 6 was launched. 26-year-old Tereshkova became the first woman in space and she orbited the Earth 45 times in 70 hours and 50 minutes of space flight.</p>

<div class="quotes">
"Anyone who has spent any time in space will love it for the rest of their lives. I achieved my childhood dream of the sky."
