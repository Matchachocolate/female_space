          <p>​​Liu Yang, the first Chinese woman in space, laid an indestructible foundation for China’s aerospace industry. In 1996, Liu Yang took the test for recruiting pilots on the recommendation of his teacher. In 1997, she was successfully admitted to the Changchun Flight Academy, became a female pilot, and joined a Chinese military transport pilot. In 2010, Liu Yang stood out from 15 candidates and formally became the second batch of astronauts in China. Then, she began to accept basic theories, aerospace environmental adaptability, and aerospace professional technology.
Liu Yang with two other crew members Jin Haipeng and Liu Wang formed an aerospace team aboard the Shenzhou 9 to launch into space on June 16, 2012. They completed the manned rendezvous and docking missions of Shenzhou 9 and Tiangong1 and realized China’s first manned spaceflight docking. The flight mission of Liu Yang also includes scientific experiment missions. In addition, a private space for Liu Yang has been set up in Shenzhou 9, which contains nutritious food and feminine hygiene products. Women are increasingly recognized in the aerospace industry. The spokeswoman for China’s manned space program said:</p>
