Sally Ride became the first woman to operate a space shuttle robotic arm.</p>

<p>Even so, before the flew, Sally Ride also suffered a lot of disrespect for female identity. In an interview before the launch of the Challenger, Ride was asked a series of questions: Do you plan to have children, and will you wear makeup in space? Or how would menstruation be handled in space? She was the third woman in space after cosmonauts Valentina Tereshkova and Svetlana Savitskaya, there is still society’s suspicion of women. But Sally believes women can change the stereotype of women in the world. she said:</p>
