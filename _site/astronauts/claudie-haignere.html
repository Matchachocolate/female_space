Armstrong's moon walk inspired Claudie Haigneré's fascination with space. "For me, it was a kind of revelation," Claudie Haigneré recalled. "I was watching a dream turn into reality. A door was open. I didn't immediately imagine that it was open for me, but the lunar landing gave me a taste for space."
