          <p>Susan Helms is a lieutenant general and flew over 30 different types of aircraft as a member of the United States Air Force. As an astronaut, she also spent over 5000 hours in space and holds the record for the longest space walk in history. She reflected on her time in space:</p>

<div class="quotes">
“When you look back on the Earth, you don’t see the borders of nations. You do see the impact of humans on Earth but you don’t see who owns what territory. And it does give you the sense, when you sit back and think about it altruistically, there really isn’t Earth ownership by the humans so much as the humans are really guests on an amazing object, which is planet Earth.”

<p>Helms said that she didn’t look too closely to</p>

<div class="quotes">
“see pollution over certain places, you can see the evidence of scarring on the landmasses by the humans working on mining and working in other areas, deforestation.”
</div>

<p>As she was looking at our planet from space, she felt that the impact of humans on Earth she could see in ways that can be a bit disconcerting. She realized that earth is a limited resource and humanity is in this together:</p>

<div class="quotes">
“There is only good that would come from sending as many people as possible to look back on our Earth and to get a sense of how beautiful and fragile it is.”
